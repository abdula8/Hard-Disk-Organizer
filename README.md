# Hard-Disk-Organizer
Firstly: you can edit the script and share experience with me have fun.
Secondly: This Python Script organizes the hard disk what ever its size be, creating big main folders: Archives, Audios, Videos, Documents, and Codes(for html, js, and more but not all))
Thirdly: This SCript for Windows Youser and specified for partition with letter "G:" that you can edit in the code by the folder link you want like: "C:\\Users\\User_name\\rest_of_link"  
or the only letter if you want to work for partition overall.
Thanks for reading.
